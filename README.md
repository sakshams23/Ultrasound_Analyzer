## ğŸ“‚ Dataset Used

This project uses the **Fetal Ultrasound Classification Dataset** for training and evaluation of a deep learning model to detect prenatal health conditions.

- ğŸ“¥ **Download Link**: [Fetal Ultrasound Images â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/ultrasound-fetus-dataset)
- ğŸ—‚ **Data Format**: JPEG images organized into labeled folders:
  - `Normal`
  - `Benign`
  - `Malignant`
- ğŸ“Š **Description**:  
  The dataset contains a variety of fetal ultrasound images annotated with three categoriesâ€”normal, benign, and malignant. It is intended to assist in the classification of ultrasound scans using machine learning models.
